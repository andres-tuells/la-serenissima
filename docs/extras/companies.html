class="content default"><h1 id="comapnies"><a href="#comapnies" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Comapnies</h1> <p>Companies exist to do something, though that goal often changes over time.<br>
Nevertheless, the goal keeps the group united, be it as vague as “Seek knowledge wherever<br>
it’s found” or as concrete as “Assassinate the king!”</p> <p><a href="/files/reign_moves.pdf">Reign Moves</a></p> <h2 id="qualities"><a href="#qualities" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Qualities</h2> <p>Each Quality reflects your Company’s ability to get things done in the world. Spying<br>
out secrets, changing governments, waging war and making a fortune—a Company can<br>
accomplish any of these. The five Qualities (Influence, Might, Treasure, Territory and<br>
Sovereignty) are discussed in detail later, but each is measured on a scale of 1-6.</p> <p>The PCs’ actions have a direct impact on the Company. By acting smartly and succeeding,<br>
you can add ordinary dice, an ED or an MD to your Company’s pools. On the other hand,<br>
PCs who make gross misjudgments or fail miserably penalize their Company’s pools.</p> <h3 id="might"><a href="#might" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Might</h3> <p>Might is a crude gauge of martial prowess. It encompasses the number of active soldiers,<br>
their training and equipment, their access to enchantment, and the worth of their<br>
commanders. A vast, unruly mob of peasants might have the same Might as a dozen wellarmed, veteran cavalry soldiers.</p> <ol><li>Well-meaning but poorly trained spearmen, possibly with leather caps.</li> <li>A thin rank of untrained soldiers with adequate weapons,<br>
or adequate soldiers with poor weapons.</li> <li>The typical city guard, a small corps of elite soldiers, or<br>
a huge gaggle of undisciplined scrappers.</li> <li>Good troops with excellent leadership, or vice versa.</li> <li>A well-honed, confident, experienced, superbly balanced fighting force.</li> <li>Tough, experienced veterans, well organized and commanded, with plenty of magic backup</li></ol> <p>Gaining temporary advantage is what being a good commander is all about. Some ways<br>
to get the advantage include…<br>
Fight From Entrenchments: A force that’s holed up in a fortress is a lot harder to<br>
eliminate than one in the open field. Getting attacked when you’re defending some<br>
impregnable fastness directly improves your chances of fending him off.<br>
Surprise Maneuver: If you can keep some grand plan secret and spring it at the last<br>
moment, you can dismay and confuse an opponent. If you successfully conceal a cavalry<br>
platoon on the hill, waiting to descend on his flank, then said flank is going to softer when<br>
the charge comes. Keeping secrets is, of course, hard.<br>
Head Hunt: Sneaking in and murdering highly visible figures in the enemy command<br>
structure is a great way to get an advantage… if you can.<br>
Scare Tactics: If you can spook the enemy troops before the engagement, by exaggerating<br>
your own fighters’ prowess or ruthlessness, your enemies are more likely to flee. Of<br>
course, this raises the question of how to get them to trust your assertions…<br>
Be Smarter: Here’s a gamble. Your commander rolls Knowledge+Strategy against their<br>
commander. The Higher set gets a temporary +1 to Might.<br>
Hire Mercenaries: Make a pure Treasure roll with no other Quality. If it succeeds, you’ve<br>
raised your Might by a point for one specific military action. (GMs may not permit this<br>
action if it’s unreasonable for mercenaries to be available.) Even with high Treasure, this roll<br>
is likely to be dodgy, so you may want to first boost that Treasure roll through some character<br>
play. Remember, this erodes your Treasure rating, just like rolling it in conjunction with<br>
another Quality. (The erosion of Qualities through use is explained on page 91.)</p> <h3 id="treasure"><a href="#treasure" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Treasure</h3> <p>1	 Every level of the operation is visibly pitiful—ragged<br>
clothing, scurvy livestock, bad haircuts…<br>
2	 A struggling Company working close to the margin, with little fiscal safety net.<br>
3	 Perhaps a small but tightly run enterprise, or a large and shabby<br>
one, or a settlement with areas of poverty and prosperity.<br>
4	 A prosperous organization, well-managed and profitable.<br>
5	 With deep reserves and a strong record of success, the Company can<br>
take greater risks without the chance of being utterly wiped out.<br>
6	 The Company radiates casual opulence, and possesses not only such significant<br>
reserves that it cannot count them, but also an evolved fiscal system for<br>
exchanging (say) quarried stone for milled wheat, or pig iron for cut timber or<br>
the services of an expert builder. On top of that, there’s plenty of potential for<br>
lending to and borrowing from other companies of equivalent stature.</p> <h3 id="influence"><a href="#influence" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Influence</h3> <p>1	 Self-absorbed and unknown, your Company has negligible pull.<br>
2	 A group like this might stumble on a fact now and then, or through<br>
sheer luck change the mind of someone noteworthy.<br>
3	 Your Company can make its opinions known directly, and<br>
can learn of major events in a timely fashion.<br>
4	 Well-informed for a decent sized area, your group understands the<br>
intangible connections between people and groups and social trends. Your<br>
knowledge lets you choose arguments calculated to persuade.<br>
5	 An array of sources can be checked against one another for accuracy, while legions<br>
of advisors (or blackmailers) can make your will felt throughout a nation.<br>
6	 For your Company, the walls have ears and the hills have eyes.<br>
When you whisper, generals shout and soldiers scream.</p> <h3 id="territory"><a href="#territory" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Territory</h3> <p>1	 A village with surrounding farms, a small town, or a neighborhood<br>
within a city. It could also be a small church, a minor organization<br>
of tradespeople, or a single large ship with crew.<br>
2	 A town, a modest duchy, legitimate authority over a large part of a big city.<br>
Alternately, a caravan of decent size, or a broad-but-shallow national conspiracy.<br>
3	 A tiny country, a fair sized region or a huge independent city. If not<br>
physical land, this could stand for a prominent regional religion, a<br>
national merchant empire, or a very large mercenary Company.<br>
4	 A large region within a large country, or a of medium size nation,<br>
or a huge independent city and its surrounding area.<br>
5	 A large country.<br>
6	 A vast and varied nation with a highly-developed culture</p> <h3 id="sovereignity"><a href="#sovereignity" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Sovereignity</h3> <p>1	 Barely-suppressed hatred.<br>
2	 Grudging, resentful obedience.<br>
3	 Typical loyalty: The followers gripe about the leaders to one another,<br>
but demonstrate patriotism when an outsider makes remarks.<br>
4	 Unusual dedication, due perhaps to personal charisma, positive<br>
events, or the abject terror of those under a tyrant.<br>
5	 The commoners take pleasure in promoting the nation. If there’s<br>
rule by fear, it’s backed with equal amounts of glorious rhetoric,<br>
probably something about having a manifest destiny.<br>
6	 Total cultural cohesion to the point of xenophobia (or at least<br>
condescending snobbery). Devotion to the ruling clique.w</p> <h3 id="combining-qualities"><a href="#combining-qualities" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Combining Qualities</h3> <p>The Quality scale is not a strict, linear mathematical progression. Here’s why: Dice in the<br>
ORE aren’t a linear mathematical progression. Your chance of getting a set when you roll<br>
two dice is one in a ten. When you roll four dice, it’s one in two. Clearly more dice aren’t<br>
only better, they’re increasingly better.<br>
That’s why it works. Here’s how it works: In order to raise a Quality by 1, you have to<br>
combine it with an equal Quality. If a Quality combines with a higher Quality, it just goes<br>
to that higher level.</p> <p>Sovereignty measures how strongly the members of the Company identify themselves<br>
with it. That’s abstract. It becomes concrete when loyalties conflict.<br>
Consider a border province in a nation. If the nation’s other provinces pass laws unfair<br>
to the frontier, it’s a conflict. The borderlands might even secede. It all comes down to<br>
whether the people see themselves first as frontiersmen, or as citizens of the nation.<br>
When companies combine, you can’t easily reinvent people’s identities. Thus,<br>
when two groups merge (or when one faction rebels from within), the changes<br>
in Sovereignty depend more on circumstance than on any formula.<br>
If the companies combine harmoniously, then the normal rules apply: Two<br>
equal ratings go to the next one up, and unequal ratings go to the highest<br>
score. The Welterwood/Harfast combo in the body text is an example.<br>
If the companies combine grudgingly, their combined Sovereignty is<br>
one lower than the higher of the two components’ scores.</p> <p>If you attack someone of equal size, you have to reduce their Sovereignty and Territory to<br>
zero to raise your Territory. This is total conquest: That Company no longer exists. If you<br>
attack and win short of complete annihilation, you can still lower their Territory: You just<br>
don’t raise your own.<br>
Picking on someone with superior Territory is different. If you succeed, you can increase<br>
your Territory by 1 and decrease theirs by 1 simply by succeeding at an annexation attack.<br>
(See page 96 for rules on annexation.) However, if you continue to attack them and<br>
completely destroy them, it won’t increase your Territory further.</p> <h3 id="conflict"><a href="#conflict" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Conflict</h3> <p>You can use a Quality once per month for each level you have in it. With Territory 6, you<br>
can apply it six times each month. Might 3 lets you can engage in three major military<br>
actions per month.<br>
There’s a catch, however. Every time you use a Quality, it takes a –1 penalty until the next<br>
month. These can be offset by raising the pool (see below) but the first military action<br>
your Might 5 war machine takes in a month is going to be far more effective than the<br>
fourth action, when it’s eroded to Might 1</p> <p>Lockfang’s Company has Influence 4, Territory 2 and Sovereignty 2. His first Influence<br>
action for the month is to seek them with an Influence+Sovereignty roll, which is 6d. He<br>
fails. He now has a –1 penalty to both Influence and Sovereignty. He tries again at 4d, and<br>
this time makes it. His Sovereignty is now effectively 0 and his Influence has dropped to<br>
2. He can combine Influence with Territory to seek the spies with a 4d pool. He fails, and<br>
each Quality drops by one point again. If he wants to keep looking for them he can roll<br>
2d. Or he can save his remaining point of Territory in case someone attacks him, or to try<br>
and improve one of his other Qualities.</p> <p>Action Effect<br>

described in full on page 98, but basically you have to meet two conditions.<br>
Reduce two of your enemy’s Qualities to zero.<br>
One of the Qualities zeroed out must be either Territory or Sovereignty.<br>
The outcome depends on the relative size of your Company and your victim. ‘Size’ in this<br>
instance means ‘combined total of all five Qualities’.<br>
If the Company was half your size or smaller, you get nothing. If it was smaller, but more<br>
than half your size, you can improve any one Quality by a point if that increase makes<br>
sense. If it was equal size or larger, you can increase any two Qualities that make sense, or<br>
maybe raise one Quality by two points if the GM agrees.</p> <h2 id="company-generation"><a href="#company-generation" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Company Generation</h2> <p>The easiest way to generate a Company is to give each player one (or more) points of<br>
Quality to assign as they wish. One per player is typical, but you could give two or more<br>
points per player.<br>
When you’re starting, you can alter the dynamic by deciding what the base PCs are like<br>
and what each character brings to the Company. A game where the players start out<br>
at Serious Adventurer (see page 35), but with only a point each to build their Company<br>
makes them scrappy outsiders raging against entrenched society. But what happens if<br>
characters at the lowest level of achievement have three points of Qualities to assign? The<br>
leadership of those who really need to rely on their Company is a different feel from those<br>
who don’t loose much if they scrap this group and start over.</p> <p>Remember, a Company has to meet certain minimum requirements every month to remain<br>
viable. It has to have at least one point in Sovereignty. Otherwise it simply collapses into<br>
a mob. It’s possible to keep going for a while with temporary improvements, but that’s life<br>
support. Eventually, the leaders have to tend to their people’s needs.</p> <p>In the rulebook it says there are 3 ways to permanently increase a Company's Quality: Combining, Conquest, and Experience.</p> <h2 id="seasons-as-company"><a href="#seasons-as-company" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Seasons as Company</h2> <p>Thematically, however, I think the best combination is to model seasons as sentient companies, to reflect the natural anthropormorphizing qualities of humanity. &quot;Autumn helped us gather our crops in, but Winter attacked us savagely.&quot; makes a surprising amount of sense as metaphor.</p> <p>Seasons as companies each have a territory equal to the territory of the company. In order for the company's territory to increase, all four (or maybe 3 of the four) seasons must be defeated.</p> <p>The Might of a season represents the numbers of inimical forces that that season employs against thinking life. Winter should have the highest might, representing Cold, Famine, and Starving Animals. (This of course, means that the PCs can go off in fights against significant opponents.)</p> <p>The Treasure of a season primarily represents resources useful to the season like edible products. While iron deposits may be useful to humans, they're not hugely useful to the season. On the other hand, as the player's company gradually fights the seasons for their treasure, the realization of that treasure should be in native natural resources to be exploited. Thus, winter raids for treasure-as-food while the players fight to keep a mine open despite winter-frost.</p> <p>The Influence of a season represents its inherent discoverability as well as its resources for getting into places sneakily. Generally the seasons will have an influence as a function of their weather and noxious-vermin. Lots of bugs, freezing fogs, downpours: all of these fight scouts trying to learn about the threats of a season. At the same time, bugs can sniff out hidden Treasure (as food).</p> <p>The Soverignty of a season represents its &quot;sheer cussedness.&quot; Is spring easily tamed, or is it a creature of flash floods, unexpected frosts, and bears?</p> <p>The territory of a season always starts out equal to the territory of the company, as it represents the current lands that the company is trying to hold and secure. Reductions in territory represent capital improvements the company puts in to mitigate the influences of any given aspect of nature. Once all X seasons have been reduced as per company conflict rules, the players can choose to expand their territory by one and begin anew, with a larger land.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
