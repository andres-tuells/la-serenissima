# Comapnies

Companies exist to do something, though that goal often changes over time.
Nevertheless, the goal keeps the group united, be it as vague as “Seek knowledge wherever
it’s found” or as concrete as “Assassinate the king!”

## Qualities

Each Quality reflects your Company’s ability to get things done in the world. Spying
out secrets, changing governments, waging war and making a fortune—a Company can
accomplish any of these. The five Qualities (Influence, Might, Treasure, Territory and
Sovereignty) are discussed in detail later, but each is measured on a scale of 1-6.

The PCs’ actions have a direct impact on the Company. By acting smartly and succeeding,
you can add ordinary dice, an ED or an MD to your Company’s pools. On the other hand,
PCs who make gross misjudgments or fail miserably penalize their Company’s pools.

### Might

Might is a crude gauge of martial prowess. It encompasses the number of active soldiers,
their training and equipment, their access to enchantment, and the worth of their
commanders. A vast, unruly mob of peasants might have the same Might as a dozen wellarmed, veteran cavalry soldiers. 

1.	 Well-meaning but poorly trained spearmen, possibly with leather caps.
2.	 A thin rank of untrained soldiers with adequate weapons,
or adequate soldiers with poor weapons.
3.	 The typical city guard, a small corps of elite soldiers, or
a huge gaggle of undisciplined scrappers.
4.	 Good troops with excellent leadership, or vice versa.
5.	 A well-honed, confident, experienced, superbly balanced fighting force.
6.	 Tough, experienced veterans, well organized and commanded, with plenty of magic backup

Gaining temporary advantage is what being a good commander is all about. Some ways
to get the advantage include…
Fight From Entrenchments: A force that’s holed up in a fortress is a lot harder to
eliminate than one in the open field. Getting attacked when you’re defending some
impregnable fastness directly improves your chances of fending him off.
Surprise Maneuver: If you can keep some grand plan secret and spring it at the last
moment, you can dismay and confuse an opponent. If you successfully conceal a cavalry
platoon on the hill, waiting to descend on his flank, then said flank is going to softer when
the charge comes. Keeping secrets is, of course, hard.
Head Hunt: Sneaking in and murdering highly visible figures in the enemy command
structure is a great way to get an advantage… if you can. 
Scare Tactics: If you can spook the enemy troops before the engagement, by exaggerating
your own fighters’ prowess or ruthlessness, your enemies are more likely to flee. Of
course, this raises the question of how to get them to trust your assertions…
Be Smarter: Here’s a gamble. Your commander rolls Knowledge+Strategy against their
commander. The Higher set gets a temporary +1 to Might.
Hire Mercenaries: Make a pure Treasure roll with no other Quality. If it succeeds, you’ve
raised your Might by a point for one specific military action. (GMs may not permit this
action if it’s unreasonable for mercenaries to be available.) Even with high Treasure, this roll
is likely to be dodgy, so you may want to first boost that Treasure roll through some character
play. Remember, this erodes your Treasure rating, just like rolling it in conjunction with
another Quality. (The erosion of Qualities through use is explained on page 91.)

### Treasure

1	 Every level of the operation is visibly pitiful—ragged
clothing, scurvy livestock, bad haircuts…
2	 A struggling Company working close to the margin, with little fiscal safety net.
3	 Perhaps a small but tightly run enterprise, or a large and shabby
one, or a settlement with areas of poverty and prosperity.
4	 A prosperous organization, well-managed and profitable.
5	 With deep reserves and a strong record of success, the Company can
take greater risks without the chance of being utterly wiped out.
6	 The Company radiates casual opulence, and possesses not only such significant
reserves that it cannot count them, but also an evolved fiscal system for
exchanging (say) quarried stone for milled wheat, or pig iron for cut timber or
the services of an expert builder. On top of that, there’s plenty of potential for
lending to and borrowing from other companies of equivalent stature.

### Influence

1	 Self-absorbed and unknown, your Company has negligible pull.
2	 A group like this might stumble on a fact now and then, or through
sheer luck change the mind of someone noteworthy.
3	 Your Company can make its opinions known directly, and
can learn of major events in a timely fashion.
4	 Well-informed for a decent sized area, your group understands the
intangible connections between people and groups and social trends. Your
knowledge lets you choose arguments calculated to persuade.
5	 An array of sources can be checked against one another for accuracy, while legions
of advisors (or blackmailers) can make your will felt throughout a nation.
6	 For your Company, the walls have ears and the hills have eyes.
When you whisper, generals shout and soldiers scream.

### Territory

1	 A village with surrounding farms, a small town, or a neighborhood
within a city. It could also be a small church, a minor organization
of tradespeople, or a single large ship with crew.
2	 A town, a modest duchy, legitimate authority over a large part of a big city.
Alternately, a caravan of decent size, or a broad-but-shallow national conspiracy.
3	 A tiny country, a fair sized region or a huge independent city. If not
physical land, this could stand for a prominent regional religion, a
national merchant empire, or a very large mercenary Company.
4	 A large region within a large country, or a of medium size nation,
or a huge independent city and its surrounding area.
5	 A large country.
6	 A vast and varied nation with a highly-developed culture

### Sovereignity

1	 Barely-suppressed hatred.
2	 Grudging, resentful obedience.
3	 Typical loyalty: The followers gripe about the leaders to one another,
but demonstrate patriotism when an outsider makes remarks.
4	 Unusual dedication, due perhaps to personal charisma, positive
events, or the abject terror of those under a tyrant.
5	 The commoners take pleasure in promoting the nation. If there’s
rule by fear, it’s backed with equal amounts of glorious rhetoric,
probably something about having a manifest destiny.
6	 Total cultural cohesion to the point of xenophobia (or at least
condescending snobbery). Devotion to the ruling clique.w

### Combining Qualities

The Quality scale is not a strict, linear mathematical progression. Here’s why: Dice in the
ORE aren’t a linear mathematical progression. Your chance of getting a set when you roll
two dice is one in a ten. When you roll four dice, it’s one in two. Clearly more dice aren’t
only better, they’re increasingly better.
That’s why it works. Here’s how it works: In order to raise a Quality by 1, you have to
combine it with an equal Quality. If a Quality combines with a higher Quality, it just goes
to that higher level. 

Sovereignty measures how strongly the members of the Company identify themselves
with it. That’s abstract. It becomes concrete when loyalties conflict.
Consider a border province in a nation. If the nation’s other provinces pass laws unfair
to the frontier, it’s a conflict. The borderlands might even secede. It all comes down to
whether the people see themselves first as frontiersmen, or as citizens of the nation.
When companies combine, you can’t easily reinvent people’s identities. Thus,
when two groups merge (or when one faction rebels from within), the changes
in Sovereignty depend more on circumstance than on any formula.
If the companies combine harmoniously, then the normal rules apply: Two
equal ratings go to the next one up, and unequal ratings go to the highest
score. The Welterwood/Harfast combo in the body text is an example.
If the companies combine grudgingly, their combined Sovereignty is
one lower than the higher of the two components’ scores.

If you attack someone of equal size, you have to reduce their Sovereignty and Territory to
zero to raise your Territory. This is total conquest: That Company no longer exists. If you
attack and win short of complete annihilation, you can still lower their Territory: You just
don’t raise your own.
Picking on someone with superior Territory is different. If you succeed, you can increase
your Territory by 1 and decrease theirs by 1 simply by succeeding at an annexation attack.
(See page 96 for rules on annexation.) However, if you continue to attack them and
completely destroy them, it won’t increase your Territory further.
