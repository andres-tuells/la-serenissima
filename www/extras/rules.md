## Experience Points

ike everyone else, 3-5 XP per session as a baseline. 1XP for doing downtime, and an extra 1XP for doing a bonus question. I can also break down this into a kind of criteria:

1XP for taking risks and being ballsy

1XP for establishing a new contact

1XP for Roleplaying well with minimal to no metatalk

1XP for participating

1XP for personal growth for the character

1XP for learning something new or making an impact on the world.

1XP for fulfilling bonds (I use the - I think it's Dungeon World - bonds to help character growth/development)

Typically it's always 3-5XP, and never any more or less. The reason for this is because it paces the growth of the characters reasonably so the problems they deal with in terms of the game world and lore grows at the same pace their capabilities do. What I wrote up there is just a breakdown if you were looking for the why behind the number.
