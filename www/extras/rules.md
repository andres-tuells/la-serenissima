# Rules

Detalle de las reglas de juego. Basadas en Vampire v5 entre otras.

## Dices

Siempre se tira el mismo dice pool. Atributo + Habilidad, Willpower o Arete.
Willpoer y similar tiran su valor temporal.

| Dificultad | Éxitos necesarios |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| Easy       | 1                 |
| Standard   | 2                 |
| Moderate   | 3-4               |
| Challenging| 5                 |
| Hard       | 6                 |
| Very hard  | 7-8               |
| Impossible | 9-10              |

7-10 éxito, 10 2 éxitos y vuelve a tirar.
Se necesita igualar o superar el núm. de éxitos.
Si no hay ningún éxito Total Failure. Algo malo pasa y no puede reintentar.

## Take half

La dificultad contra pnj en tiradas opuestas es su dice pool/2 redondeado hacia arriba.

## Succed at a cost

En caso pj tenga éxitos pero le falte 1 puede obtar por tener éxito por un coste.

## Teamwork

Se pueden combinar las tiradas en 1 pool. Cada jugador tira aparte.

### Skill Specializations

Tirar un dado extra.

### Virtue and Vice

Caer en tu Vicio permite recuperar 1 punto de Willpower.
Vicio es algo que sufre el pj, no sus compañeros.
Mantener tu Virtud a pesar del coste permite recuperar todo el Willpower.

Virtudes: Generous, Just, Loyal, Ambitious, Courageous, Honest, Hopeful, Loving, Patient
Vicios: Arrogant, Competitive, Greedy, Addictive, Corrupt, Cruel, Deceitful, Dogmatic, Hasty, Hateful

### Social Combat

Tiradas opuestas con Willpower Damage. Empieza como daño no letal al principio y continua como agravado.
Agravado cuesta más en recuperar, no vale con Virtudes y Vicios.

### Chases
It’s very simple. A chase can either be:
v A one-and-done contest: each participant
makes a Chase test, the winner either catches the runner or gets away.
v A best-of-three series of contests: each participant makes a Chase test, the winner of
two out of three contests either catches the
runner or gets away.


### Combat

Superficial is easy to heal and won’t impair kindred.
Aggravated is difficult and coste intensive to heal and does hinder a kindred somewhat.

Whether something does aggravated damage depends on the type of damage, the creature the damage is applied to and the context.

Puños +0
Brass knuckes, piedra +1
Cuchillo, florete, garrote +2
Ballesta +2
Espada. pistola, escopeta +3
Mandoble, alabarda, trabuco +4

**3. Damage is margin + weapons base damage.**

**Armadura quita éxitos, 1 o 2 en función covertura**

Armadura ligera -1
Armadura pesada -2, -1 a Dex

Uso de capa, 2 armas vs 1, escudo, mejor terreno --> +1d

### Critical Injury
After taking damage while Impaired and after
converting it, roll a d10 on the Critical Injury table, adding the number of Aggravated damage
points currently on the track to the roll. This can
lead to further penalties (or even instant death),
tracked independently of the abstract damage
on the Health Track.
1-3 Stunned – Pay a point of Willpower or
lose a turn.
4-6 Knocked Out (Mortal) / Stun as above
(Vampire)
7 Eyes gouged – Vision-based rolls at -3
8: Concussed – Dexterity rolls -2; Mental
rolls -2
9 Broken limb or joint – Dexterity rolls
-2; Athletics at -4
10 Skull fracture – Dexterity rolls -2;
Mental rolls at -4
11 Massive wound – All rolls at -3
12 Crippled – Limb lost or mangled beyond use
13+ Death (Mortal) or immediate Torpor 

### Armor
Each point of armor changes one point of Aggravated damage (per damage roll) to Superficial
damage, which is then halved according to the
standard rules for Superficial damage.
SAMPLE ARMOR VALUES
Kevlar vest 2
Tactical SWAT/military armor
4


**DETAILED COMBAT EXAMPLES USING SIMPLE COMBAT AS CONFIRMED ACCURATE BY KARIM**
Scenario A: T is attacked by A, B and C. T wants to try to damage them all back.
T has an attack pool of 8.
T chooses to split 2/3/3 against A/B/C.
A, B and C all use their full attack pool.
The person with the highest margin does damage, or on a tie it's a margin of 1 + any weapon damage.
Scenario B: T wants to dodge A, B and C.
T has a dodge pool of 6.
A rolls attack against T's dodge pool with no penalty.
B rolls attack against T's dodge pool -1 (5 dice)
C rolls attack against T's dodge pool -2 (4 dice)
Scenario C: T is attacked by A, B and C. T wants to damage C (as the weakest link) and dodge A and B. Karim clarified that you DO switch pools when you do this, despite the example not showing that.
T has an attack pool of 8 and a dodge pool of 6.
T and C roll their attacks against each other per Scenario A.
A rolls attack against T's dodge pool -1 (5 dice) per Scenario B
B rolls attack against T's dodge pool -2 (4 dice) per Scenario B
For Ranged combat, it's a little different:
If two targets are shooting at each other, they both roll a contested ATTR+Firearms to do damage to each other, as there is cover assumed (think of it like the movies where guy leans out from behind something, lets off some shots and leans back in).
If a target is actively dodging, it's ATTR+Firearms vs Dex+Athletics, with modifications for cover as described on pg. 125
If a target has no access to cover at all, and isn't trying to dodge, then it's a roll vs. Difficulty 2 (2 successes needed), with the margin damage done as normal.
You'd apply any of the above to Ranged combat when it's appropriate (three guys firing at one guy, for example).

## Experience Points

ike everyone else, 3-5 XP per session as a baseline. 1XP for doing downtime, and an extra 1XP for doing a bonus question. I can also break down this into a kind of criteria:

1XP for taking risks and being ballsy

1XP for establishing a new contact

1XP for Roleplaying well with minimal to no metatalk

1XP for participating

1XP for personal growth for the character

1XP for learning something new or making an impact on the world.

1XP for fulfilling bonds (I use the - I think it's Dungeon World - bonds to help character growth/development)

Typically it's always 3-5XP, and never any more or less. The reason for this is because it paces the growth of the characters reasonably so the problems they deal with in terms of the game world and lore grows at the same pace their capabilities do. What I wrote up there is just a breakdown if you were looking for the why behind the number.

Permitir gastar 1 punto en Avatar solo, 2 si han experiemntado Quest, Quiet o Paradoja

Puntos de experiencia por laboratorio, rituales, ... fuera partida.
