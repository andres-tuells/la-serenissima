5. Palazzo Contarini dal Zaffo
This prestigious Cannaregio building beside the Fondamenta Gasparo Contarini is home to the Casino degli Spiriti (Casino of the Spirits), so-called for several reasons. Firstly, the noise of the waves slapping against the isolated building sounds like the howling of a ghost. Secondly, the tormented “spirits” for whom the casino is named frequented the building at the beginning of the 1500s: artists, writers and painters such as Giorgione, Titian, Sansovino and Luzzo. The latter was one of the most unhappy, having taken his own life to escape the pain of his unrequited love for Cecilia, the lover of Giorgione. These spirits have often been summoned during seances.
