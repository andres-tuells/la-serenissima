There's quite a number of character and story ideas that can be pulled from Venice's history up to 1220 AD. Among them:

Doge Vitale (II) Michiel was killed in 1172 by a member of a mob for his gullibility in confronting the Byzantine Empire, losing a large portion of Venice's fighting men as well as ships to plague, and for likely bringing that plague back to Venice. Though past Doge's had been killed by Venetians before, it had not happened for over 200 years. The authories tried and executed the killer himself. Orders then came down to raze the killer's house and prohibit any stone buildings to be erected in the lot. This tradition was held to until the 20th century.
