## Machines

A Stitch in Time is a Penny Dreadful adventure for
the Through the Breach roleplaying game. Unlike
other Penny Dreadful adventures, A Stitch in Time
was the focus of the 2017 Worldwide Through the
Breach Event.
This adventure consists of four Acts, each one
encompassing one to two play sessions. Fourteen
pre-generated characters have been provided for
players to control during these adventures, but the
players are also welcome to use characters of their
own creation.
Over the course of this adventure, the Fated find
themselves assisting Kizzy Shepard, an inventor who
is seeking to create a machine capable of opening
rifts between Earth and Malifaux.
Unfortunately for Kizzy (and the Fated), her
machine doesn't quite function as intended. Instead
of sending the Fated to Earth, the machine actually
hurls them backwards through time, leaving them
in the late eighteenth century. As they attempt to
migrate through the sinister plans of an eccentric
necromancer and a doomed love triangle, the Fated
will have the opportunity to change history... for
better or worse.
This book includes all the rules and stats you need
to run this adventure. As a result, the only other
book you truly need to use this supplement is the
Core Rules.
As this is a Penny Dreadful, if you are not a
Fatemaster who plans on running this adventure,
read no further. You wouldn't want to spoil the
surprise!
